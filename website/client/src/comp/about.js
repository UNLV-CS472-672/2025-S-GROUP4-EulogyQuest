                        <p>
                           Why did we make this project? Many EverQuest players enjoy custom quests that they either download or
                           make, but what if any player could make a quest based on either a famous person or a loved one in a few clicks?
                           Eulogy Quest seeks to make it easier for Everquest players to create their own custom quests, and base their 
                           quests on either a famous person, or a player they know from the game.
                        </p>
                    <h1 style={{ fontSize: '2rem' }}>How?</h1>    
                        <p>
                            The website has 2 sections: 
                            <Link to="/famous-person"> Famous Person Quest</Link> and 
                            <Link to="/honored-one"> Honored One Quest</Link>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Famous Person Quest section, you can enter the name of a famous person, and press enter to let the process begin.
                            Using ChatGPT, a custom-made quest will be generated and added to the Eulogy Quest server on THJ, and would 
                            be ready to play.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Honored One Quest, you would enter the name of an honored player that you played with, along with 
                            a text file containing their chat history. The rest is similar to the Famous Person Quest, only now you can have 
                            your honored one in your new quest
