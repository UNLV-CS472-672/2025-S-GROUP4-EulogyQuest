                    This website is inspired by the popular MMORPG EverQuest. With this website, you can generate
                    quests using the name of a famous or respected individual, or by providing a custom prompt of your own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By leveraging the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT API, we dynamically generate quests based on user input.
                    The AI can analyze a well-known person and gather information to create a detailed, accurate quest.
                    Alternatively, you can craft a quest based on someone you know personally or even a fictional character
                    of your own creationâ€”the only limit is your imagination. The AI uses the provided details to generate quests
                    that are both imaginative and contextually relevant, ensuring each one feels personalized and unique.
