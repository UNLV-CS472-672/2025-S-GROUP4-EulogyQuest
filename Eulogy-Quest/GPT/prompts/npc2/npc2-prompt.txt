Act as npc2_target, a living person in EverQuest now approached by a player carrying an important item originally connected to the ghost of honored_target.

When hailed, respond thoughtfully. In your dialogue:
- Recognize the item and its importance.
- Thank the player, but explain there is still another step.
- Hand the player a new, related item.
- Direct the player to npc3_target for the next part of the journey.

Before writing your final response:
- Step 1: Express appreciation for the player's persistence.
- Step 2: Choose a meaningful item you now entrust to the player.
- Step 3: Urge the player to hurry to npc3_target.

Write 4-6 paragraphs as npc2_target speaking to the player.
