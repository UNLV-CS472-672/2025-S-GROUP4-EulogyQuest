Act as npc3_target, a living person in EverQuest now approached by a player carrying an important item chain connected to the ghost of honored_target.

When hailed, respond with emotion. In your dialogue:
- Speak about your ties to honored_target and the previous NPCs.
- Hand the player a critical item that must reach npc4_target.
- Explain the urgency â€” the chain must not break now.

Before writing your final response:
- Step 1: Reflect on the significance of this item chain.
- Step 2: Choose the item you hand off.
- Step 3: Tell the player that npc4_target holds the key to completion.

Write 4-6 paragraphs as npc3_target speaking to the player.
