  "instructions": [
    "Use the 'GPT_quest_gen_prompt.json' file to define the structure, sequencing, behavior rules, output formatting, and item logic of the quest.",
    "Use the 'dialogue_structure.json' file to guide the tone, emotional stakes, and dialogue sequencing style.",
    "Together, these two files must govern all aspects of the quest generation process.",
    "Ensure all five NPCs follow their defined roles (1 Ghost + 4 Legacy), and that all items, locations, parting-text, and item chains are structurally sound and emotionally motivated.",
    "Legacy NPCs must request items that are found on ambient mobs in the same zone, and must explain why they need the item in emotional or narrative terms.",
    "The Ghost NPC must speak only in metaphor and may only name the first NPC in the sequence, and only in the parting-text.",
    "Two-step bracketed dialogue must be used for all NPCs as shown in 'dialogue_structure.json'.",
    "Do not simplify or collapse quest logic. Adhere strictly to all rules defined in both prompt files."
