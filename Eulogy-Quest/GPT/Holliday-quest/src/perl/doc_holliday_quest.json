  "story": "In 1881, John 'Doc' Holliday stood beside Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. A gambler, a gunslinger, and a former dentist, Holliday was wracked with tuberculosis but chose loyalty over safety. The thirty-second gunfight became legend, but it was Doc\u2019s quiet sacrifice and steadfast support for a friend that carved his name into history. The cost of friendship, the edge of law, and the pain behind a smile \u2014 these are the truths Doc carried.",
