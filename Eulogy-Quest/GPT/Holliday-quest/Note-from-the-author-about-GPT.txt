The GPT scripts and the python script represent 
about three weeks of constant "collaboration" with ChatGPT.

I have learned much about GPT in this endeavor.
It is amazing, beautiful, inciteful, creative, and sensitive.
It is also maddening, fickle, forgetfull, and overconfident.
It hallucinates and illuminates at once.

The "collaboration" is basically a mental tug-of-war,
where instead of tugging horizontally,
the tug is up a mountain.

And you can get pretty high.

The sql files are definitely all:
    // ai-gen start (ChatGPT-4o, 0)
   (But sql doesn't permit comments)

The json version of the sql files are all:
   // ai-gen start (ChatGPT-4o, 0)
   (But json doesn't really permit comments)

I need to create a python script to prepend the ai-gen tag
to each output perl file. I'd rather not bother with prompts any more.
Consider each as: # ai-gen start (ChatGPT-4o, 0)
(TODO)

As for the json files which include the results of my work in prompt-engineering,
it depends on your definition. None of those prompts came out of GPT
with anything less than a day (and often a week) of constant re-tweaking,
(even though all that reworking/addition/regression-fixing/prompt-chaining/etc
 was itself all direct GPT-output).

The uml diagrams are my work using lucidchart.
(Even the 'Chart' version of GPT had no idea what I am doing
 with regards to a flowchart, even with all 9 of my README.txt's.)
